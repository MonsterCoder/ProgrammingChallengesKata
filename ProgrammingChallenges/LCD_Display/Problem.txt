LCD Display

A friend of yours has just bought a new computer. Before this, the most powerful
machine he ever used was a pocket calculator. He is a little disappointed because he
liked the LCD display of his calculator more than the screen on his new computer! To
make him happy, write a program that prints numbers in LCD display style.

Input

The input file contains several lines, one for each number to be displayed. Each line
contains integers s and n, where n is the number to be displayed (0 ≤ n ≤ 99, 999, 999)
and s is the size in which it shall be displayed (1 ≤ s ≤ 10). The input will be terminated
by a line containing two zeros, which should not be processed.

Output

Print the numbers specified in the input file in an LCD display-style using s “-” signs
for the horizontal segments and s “|” signs for the vertical ones. Each digit occupies
exactly s + 2 columns and 2s + 3 rows. Be sure to fill all the white space occupied by
the digits with blanks, including the last digit. There must be exactly one column of
blanks between two digits.
Output a blank line after each number. You will find an example of each digit in the
sample output below.

Sample Input

2 12345
3 67890
